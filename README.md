This app is more practice to help you understand the syntax and process of creating an api (in your server file) and hitting endpoints on that api using axios in your react app


The instructions are found in the index.js file inside your server and in the app.js file inside src.

This project will be the most beneficial if you create the endpoint in your server first, and then use axios to hit that endpoint. Line the files up so that the endpoint line matches with the line that you're writing your axios request.
